About Me
======
I am a Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) candidate at Universiti Sains Malaysia, specializing in epidemiology. My research focuses on spatial and temporal analysis of infectious diseases, with a particular interest in molecular epidemiology. As an R user, I leverage advanced statistical methods and geospatial tools to investigate disease patterns and inform public health interventions.

This website showcases my academic journey, including my CV, publications, workshops, and talks. It serves as a platform to share my work and connect with fellow researchers and public health professionals.

I am open to discussions, collaborations, and other professional activities related to public health research and epidemiology. Feel free to connect with me!
